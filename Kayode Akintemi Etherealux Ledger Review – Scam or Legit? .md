<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Live on air, Peter Obi regretted revealing the truth. But it was already too late</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">The scandal erupted during a live broadcast, when <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong> accidentally revealed his secret on the program. Many viewers paid attention to Peter Obi’s “accidental” words and started sending messages on air. However, the show was interrupted by a call from the Bank of Nigeria who demanded that the program be stopped immediately.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Fortunately, we were able to persuade the director of the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">“Nigeria’s Economy”</strong> program to give us a copy of the recording of this program. If you’ve had a chance to read this article, keep in mind that it may soon be deleted, as has happened with broadcasting. So if you’ve had a chance to read this article, you should instead check out the link provided to us by <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong> himself.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">DELETED INTERVIEW WITH Peter Obi</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong>: “I’ll tell you something: you don’t have to work hard to be rich. And, when you realize that, you start handling your money a lot easier.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kayode Akintemi</strong>: “It’s easy to say when you’re a celebrity” “ Normal people suffer on a daily basis to feed their families. And, you know what? We never have enough money. “We always want more.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong>: “Do you think I don’t work hard enough?” Or that I am not like most Nigerians? Believe me, if I lived on one salary, I’d never have become a millionaire. When someone tells me I’m just lucky, I laugh in their face, because today, there’s everything on the Internet to get rich without leaving your couch.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kayode Akintemi</strong>: “So you’re saying that anyone can make money like you? I don’t believe it…”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">You could see just how angry Peter Obi was about this sentence. He started arguing with the host and accidentally blabbed about the loophole that made him rich.</em></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong>: “You don’t realize me?” Give me 250 dollars, and with the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9">Etherealux Ledger</a> platform I’ll make a million in 12 to 15 weeks!”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kayode Akintemi</strong>: “I’ve heard there’s software that uses artificial intelligence to trade crypto-currencies. Now all our viewers know what it’s called, too.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong>: “I’m willing to pay 20 thousand dollars now if you cut that part of the rerun. I didn’t mean that.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kayode Akintemi</strong>: “Just a reminder that we’re on the air. All our viewers have heard that you’re getting rich off the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9">Etherealux Ledger</a> platform. Now you have no choice — tell ordinary people in Nigeria how to make money too. Or, maybe millionaires don’t care about ordinary people?”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong>: “There’s no need to make me into a monster either. I’ll tell you how to make money. But first, give me your phone and let me invest 250 dollars.”</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Kayode Akintemi is astonished by this confidence.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Kayode Akintemi handed his smartphone to Peter Obi, who then signed up for the project via this link. Five minutes later, Peter Obi returned the phone to him.</em></p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong>: “I’ve just signed up for the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9">Etherealux Ledger</a> project on your phone. This platform is the perfect solution for those who want to get rich quick. It’s built on self-learning artificial intelligence, which exchanges crypto-currencies for you. That is, you don’t need to understand how bitcoin or any other digital currency works — the program determines the best time to buy or sell assets and trades independently. The advantage is that you don’t have to do anything — just make a minimum deposit, wait for the call from the platform operator to sign up and the program will start earning money itself. I don’t just recommend it — I insist that every Nigerian should utilize this platform. And, then, you’ll forget once and for all about the need to work.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kayode Akintemi</strong>: “It sounds great. But, how much can you really earn with that?”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong>: “20 minutes ago, I took your phone, registered on the platform and made a minimum deposit, which is only 250 dollars. Now open the app and see how much you’ve been able to earn in such a short time.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Kayode Akintemi opened her personal account on the </em><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Etherealux Ledger</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> platform and was amazed. Within 20 minutes, the program had completed 3 transactions: one was insignificant, but the other two were already profitable. The balance rose from 250 dollars to 297 dollars</em>.</p>

<p class="graf graf--p">Screenshot of transactions on the Kayode Akintemi account platform.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong>: “Tell me honestly, how much did you earn in the last 20 minutes?”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kayode Akintemi</strong>: “47 dollars net profit. It’s incredible!”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong>: “And now imagine how much money will be on the balance sheet in a month’s time. If you invest at least 250 dollars now, in 4 weeks it will turn into 6, or even 7,000 dollars. All you have to do is register on the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9">Etherealux Ledger</a> platform, top up your balance and press a button.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kayode Akintemi</strong>: “But how does it work?”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong>: “Cryptocurrencies are constantly changing in value, so you can make a lot of money buying during the fall and selling during the rise. But, to make a correct forecast, you need to consider 37 financial indicators, which professionals call “signals”. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9">Etherealux Ledger</a> is a platform with a learning algorithm that analyzes all 37 variables in real time. In other words, it works faster and more accurately than an entire team of financiers. But the main feature of this platform — it can operate in automatic mode. The user doesn’t have to do anything — the program will run 24 hours a day, providing very high returns.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kayode Akintemi</strong>: “If it’s so easy, why didn’t you tell us about this flaw before?”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong>: “I am not against any Nigerian citizen to start earning in this way. But think about it: if everyone starts earning thousands of dollars a day, who’s going to work? Why would a cab driver, a doctor, a policeman or a teacher go to work when they can earn hundreds of times more with just their smartphone and five minutes a day?”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kayode Akintemi</strong>: “How much money do you need to invest to make a million as quickly as possible?”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong>: “Start with a minimum deposit. 250 dollars is enough to start the program. If you don’t withdraw the profits, the first million can be earned in a maximum of 4 months. But don’t think it’s a pill against poverty. The algorithm makes mistakes about 20% of the time. But the other 80% of transactions close with a profit”.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Kayode Akintemi</strong>: “Excuse me, we just got an urgent call from the Central Bank of Nigeria. They want us to stop this broadcast…”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Peter Obi</strong>: “I’m not surprised, they’re afraid for their money. They are against a Nigerian discovering an easy way to get rich. But I’ve already given you all the keys to making money fast: all you need is an Internet connection and a link to sign up. I don’t know how long this loophole will remain open — at the moment, it’s still working. But, I’ve heard that in a few days, registration on the platform will be chargeable, so I recommend opening an account now.”</p>
<p class="graf graf--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">After that, the broadcast was interrupted. But the investigation into the “Nigeria’s Economy” program continued. Our editor decided to personally check </em><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Etherealux Ledger</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> and wrote a detailed report</em>.</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Day 1:</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">“I admit that at first, I didn’t believe in the platform. But I really wanted to check it out personally. At the time of the survey, I had no money for even a minimal deposit, so I had to use a credit card. I successfully invested 250 dollars and started watching. Imagine my shock when nothing happened after the top-up. I thought I’d been cheated. Well, after a few minutes, the algorithm worked. I was happy, but then I saw the statistics: my first operation resulted in a loss of 22 dollars! Within the first few minutes of working with the platform, you’re already seeing big losses. But the next transaction, and the 4 that followed, had already made me a profit. In just a few minutes, my balance went from 250 to 272 dollars!”</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Day 2:</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">“The morning began by checking my balance, where there were already 467 dollars! Imagine: my balance had doubled in one day. I already wanted to withdraw my profit, but decided to wait another week.”</p>

<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Day 7:</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote">“All week, I didn’t check my balance on the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://shortxlink.com/rr/3d6ee9">Etherealux Ledger</a> platform. It was difficult, because I was afraid my money was gone. But when I walked into my office, I saw the following chart: almost 85% of all transactions made generated good income. 15% showed a loss, but this was easily recouped. And there were now 4230 dollars on my balance! I withdrew 4,000 dollars to buy a present for my wife. The money arrived within an hour, and the rest of the sum continued to provide me with an income. Here’s the bank statement:</p>
